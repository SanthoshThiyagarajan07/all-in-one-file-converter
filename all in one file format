Sure! Here's a simplified version of a file converter script in Python. This example will convert a given file (PDF, JPG, PNG, or DOCX) to a PDF file using the appropriate library. Please note that this example is simplified and may not cover all edge cases or file types. Also, it focuses on converting to PDF only.

Make sure you have Pillow, PyPDF2, and docx2pdf installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install Pillow PyPDF2 docx2pdf
Here's the simplified script:

python
Copy code
import os
from PIL import Image
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger
from docx2pdf import convert as docx2pdf_convert

def convert_to_pdf(input_file, output_file):
    if input_file.lower().endswith('.pdf'):
        # If it's already a PDF, just copy it
        os.rename(input_file, output_file)
    elif input_file.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png')):
        # Convert image to PDF
        image = Image.open(input_file)
        image.save(output_file, 'PDF', resolution=100.0)
    elif input_file.lower().endswith('.docx'):
        # Convert DOCX to PDF
        docx2pdf_convert(input_file, output_file)
    else:
        print("Unsupported file format.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = "example.docx"  # Change this to your input file
    output_file = os.path.splitext(input_file)[0] + ".pdf"

    convert_to_pdf(input_file, output_file)

    print(f"Conversion completed. Output saved to: {output_file}")
In this simplified version:

We have a single convert_to_pdf function that takes an input file and converts it to PDF using the appropriate method based on the file type.
The function checks the file extension and then converts it accordingly:
If it's a PDF file, it just renames it to the desired output name.
If it's an image (JPG, JPEG, PNG), it converts it to PDF using Pillow.
If it's a DOCX file, it converts it to PDF using docx2pdf library.
This script will convert your input file to PDF based on its type. You can modify it further to add more file types or output formats if needed
